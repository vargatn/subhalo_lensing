"""
General subhalo lensing framework.

Intended to be used to measure, predict and fit the <\Delta\Sigma> profiles
around subhalos (satelitte galaxies) embedded in local density peaks
 (a.k.a "clusters" or "groups").


Contents:
----------

* I/O side:
    - wrapper for Erin's xshear program and output

* Data side:
    - \Delta\Sigma stacking
    - Absolute magnitudes and k-correction
    - Spherical rotations and disctance

And much more including:

* forward modelling suite for predicting delta sigma profiles
