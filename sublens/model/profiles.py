"""
Density and \Delta\Sigma profile functions


The core functionality is focused on different versions of NFW profiles.
Also includes conversion for (m_200, c_200, z) ->  (r_s, rho_s)

Contents:
----------
*   3D NFW density in h^2 M_\odot / Mpc^3
*   2D NFW density in h M_\odot / Mpc^2
*   \Delta\Sigma of NFW in h M_\odot / Mpc^2

*   conversion tool for NFW parameters
